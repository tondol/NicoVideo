Nicovideo is a simple library to manipulate resources on Niconico-douga with Ruby.
Nicovideo requires Ruby 1.9.* to work.

This library is crearly different from "nicovideo gem,"
but I use "nicovideo gem" as a reference to write some codes.

A feature of this library is that any other gems are unnecessarry.
You simply have to put a few files into your directory to download videos on Niconico-douga.
See "sample.rb" to know usage of this library.
