Nicovideo is a simple library to manipulate resources on Niconico-douga with Ruby.
Nicovideo requires Ruby 1.9.* to work.

This is a different library from "nicovideo gem,"
but I reference lines of code in "nicovideo gem" to write this library.

A feature of "Nicovideo" is that any other gems are unnecessarry.
You simply have to put a few files into your directory to download videos on Niconico-douga.
See "sample.rb" to know usage of this library.
