NicoVideo
====

Nicovideo is a simple library to manipulate resources on Niconico-douga with Ruby.
Nicovideo requires Ruby 1.9.* or above to work.

I reference lines of code in "nicovideo gem" to write this library.

Most important feature of "Nicovideo" is that any other gems are unnecessarry.
You simply have to put a few source files into your directory to work with Niconico-douga.
See "example.rb" to know usage of this library.

Nicovideo source code is published on GitHub: http://github.com/tondol/nicovideo/
